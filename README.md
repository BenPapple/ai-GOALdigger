### Introduction

This is the work of a 5 person student team at University of Hagen for the practical course in AI. The goal of the course is oriented at the [The Multi-Agent Programming Contest](https://multiagentcontest.org/).

The [multi-agent system (MAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system) is written in the [GOAL agent programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOAL_agent_programming_language).

### Launch

The MAS can be launched as is with the PowerShell script.

Or it can be launched directly in the Eclipse IDE with [GOAL plugin](https://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOAL/overview) installed.

### License

runtime-2.2.0.jar is a headless [GOAL interpreter](https://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOAL/overview) and open source.

eismassim-4.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar comes from [agentcontest/massim_2022 repository](https://github.com/agentcontest/massim_2022) and is under the AGPLv3+.

Everything else belongs to the team pending further decisions.
